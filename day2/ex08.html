            Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or
            build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt
            components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.</p>

        <h1>What is jQuery?</h1>

        <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal
            and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works
            across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the
            way that millions of people write JavaScript.</p>
